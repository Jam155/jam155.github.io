<div class="introduction">
  <p>Hi, my names James.</p>

  <p>I'm a web developer living and working in the North East of England. I thought I'd have a go at this whole personal
    website melarkey again. So here we are.</p>

  <p>Currently my interests and hobbies include but are not limited to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Programming</li>
    <li>Reading</li>
    <li>Running</li>
    <li>Guitar</li>
    <li>German</li>
    <li class="faint">Learning to Dance</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I'm going to use this space to hopefully show off some things I think are cool. Keep track of progress of my
  various hobbies, and hopefully blog and have some fun along the way.</p>
